This was a really nice challenge
I got to use more professional cool concepts like transitioning, hover and opactity, ofcourse alongside flexbox, position.

I feel a pretty happy of what I've designed, lil unsure about the responsive designing still, but getting better.

Happily open for your opinions :)
